# S3.2 : Gene Significance and Module Membership
#====    

###We quantify associations of individual genes with our trait of interest (weight) by defining Gene Significance GS as (the absolute value of) the correlation between the gene and the trait. 

###For each module, we also define a quantitative measure of module membership MM as the correlation of the module eigengene and the gene expression profile.

###This allows us to quantify the similarity of all genes on the array to every module.

#  Intramodular analysis: identifying genes with high GS and MM
      

###Using the GS and MM measures, we can identify genes that have a high significance for weight as well as high module membership in interesting modules.

###As an example, we look at the brown module that has the highest association with weight.

###We plot a scatterplot of Gene Significance vs. Module Membership in the brown module:


module = "brown"
column = match(module, modNames)

moduleGenes = moduleColors==module

sizeGrWindow(7, 7)

par(mfrow = c(1,1))

# S3.3    Summary output of network analysis results
#====      

### We have found modules with high association with our trait of interest, 
#and have identified their central players by the Module Membership measure.

###We now merge this statistical information with gene annotation and write out a file that
#summarizes the most important results and can be inspected in standard spreadsheet software 
#such as MS Excel or Open Office Calc.

###Our expression data are only annotated by probe ID names: the command
names(data_raw1)
###will return all probe IDs included in the analysis. Similarly,

names(data_raw1)[moduleColors=="brown"]
###will return probe IDs belonging to the brown module. 

###To facilitate interpretation of the results, 
#we use a probe annotation file

lnames = load(file = "data-project/annotation-final.RData")

#renaming the rows 
rownames(datTraits) = traitData[traitRows, 7]

probes2annot = match(probes, annotation_final$ensembl_gene_id)


# The following is the number of probes without annotation:
sum(is.na(probes2annot))
# Should return 0.

###We now create a data frame holding the following information for all probes: 
#probe ID, gene symbol, Locus Link ID (Entrez code), module color, gene significance for dev, and module membership and p-values in all modules. 

###The modules will be ordered by their significance for dev, 
#with the most significant ones to the left.

# Create the starting data frame

###Our previous analysis has identified several modules (labeled brown, red, and salmon) that are highly associated with weight.

#==== 
# S4.1   Output gene lists for use with online software and services
#====     

###One option is to simply export a list of gene identifiers 
#that can be used as input for several popular gene ontology
#and functional enrichment analysis suites such as David or AmiGO. 

###For example, we write out the LocusLinkID (entrez) codes for the brown module into a file:
getwd()
# Read in the probe annotation
lnames = load(file = "data-project/annotation-final.RData")

# Match probes in the data set to the probe IDs in the annotation file
probes = names(data_raw1)
probes2annot = match(probes, annotation_final$ensembl_gene_id)

# Get the corresponding Locuis Link IDs
allLLIDs = annotation_final$ensembl_gene_id[probes2annot]

#4.b   Enrichment analysis directly within R
#====

###The WGCNA package now contains a function to perform GO enrichment analysis using a simple, single step.

###To run the function, Biconductor packages GO.db, AnnotationDBI, and the appropriate organism-specific annotation package(s) need to be installed before running this code.

###The organism-specific packages have names of the form org.Xx.eg.db, where Xx stands for organism code, for example, Mm for mouse, Hs for human, etc.

###The only exception is yeast, for which no org.Xx.eg.db package is available; instead, the package carries the name org.Sc.sgd.db.

###Please visit the Bioconductor main page at http://www.bioconductor.org to download and install the required packages.

###In our case we are studying gene expressions from wheat, so this code needs the package ....

###Calling the GO enrichment analysis function GOenrichmentAnalysis is very simple. 

###The function takes a vector of module labels, and the Entrez (a.k.a. Locus Link) codes for the genes whose labels are given.


GOenr = GOenrichmentAnalysis(moduleColors, allLLIDs, organism = "wheat", nBestP = 10)

###   ###   ###   ###  Q  ###   ###   ###   ###

### enrichmentAnalysis is apparently the new verion on GOenrichment analysis
#The function runs for awhile and returns a long list, the most interesting component of which is:

tab = GOenr$bestPTerms[[4]]$enrichment

#This is an enrichment table containing the 10 best terms for each module present in moduleColors.

#Names of the columns within the table can be accessed by:
names(tab)

###We refer the reader to the help page of the function within R (available using ?GOenrichmentAnalysis at the R prompt) for details of what each column means. Because the term definitions can be quite long, the table is a bit difficult to display on the screen. 

#For readers who prefer to look at tables in Excel or similar spreadsheet software, it is best to
#save the table into a file and open it using their favorite tool:

write.table(tab, file = "data-processed/GOEnrichmentTable.csv", sep = ",", quote = TRUE, row.names = FALSE)


#On the other hand, to quickly take a look at the results, one can also abridge the table a bit and display it directly on screen:

keepCols = c(1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13);
screenTab = tab[, keepCols];
# Round the numeric columns to 2 decimal places:
numCols = c(3, 4);
screenTab[, numCols] = signif(apply(screenTab[, numCols], 2, as.numeric), 2)
# Truncate the the term name to at most 40 characters
screenTab[, 7] = substring(screenTab[, 7], 1, 40)
# Shorten the column names:

#5.a   Visualizing the gene network
#====

###One way to visualize a weighted network is to plot its heatmap, Fig. 1.

###Each row and column of the heatmap correspond to a single gene.

###The heatmap can depict adjacencies or topological overlaps, with light colors denoting low adjacency (overlap) and darker colors higher adjacency (overlap).

###In addition, the gene dendrograms and module colors are plotted along the top and left side of the heatmap.

###The package provides a convenient function to create such network plots;

###Fig. 1 was created using the following code.

###This code can be executed only if the network was calculated using a single-block approach (that is, using the 1-step automatic or the step-by-step tutorials). 

###If the networks were calculated using the block-wise approach, the user will need to modify this code to perform the visualization in each block separately.

###The modification is simple and we leave it as an exercise for the interested reader.

###Calculate topological overlap anew: this could be done more efficiently by saving the TOM calculated during module detection, but let us do it again here.

lnames = load(file = "data-processed/wheatTOM-block.1.RData")

#5.b   Visualizing the network of eigengenes
#====  

### It is often interesting to study the relationships among the found modules. 
###One can use the eigengenes as representative profiles and quantify module similarity by eigengene correlation.

###The package contains a convenient function plotEigengeneNetworks that generates a summary plot of the eigengene network. 

###It is usually informative to add a clinical trait (or multiple traits) to the eigengenes to see how the traits fit into the eigengene network:


# Recalculate module eigengenes
MEs = moduleEigengenes(data_raw1, moduleColors)$eigengenes

# Isolate dev from the clinical traits
dev = as.data.frame(datTraits$dev);
names(dev) = "dev"
# Add the dev to existing module eigengenes
MET = orderMEs(cbind(MEs, dev))

# Plot the relationships among the eigengenes and the trait
sizeGrWindow(5,7.5);
par(cex = 0.9)
plotEigengeneNetworks(MET, "", 
                      marDendro = c(0,4,1,2), 
                      marHeatmap = c(3,4,1,2), 
                      cex.lab = 0.8, 
                      xLabelsAngle = 90)


### The function produces a dendrogram of the eigengenes and trait(s), and a heatmap of their relationships.

### To split the dendrogram and heatmap plots, we can use the following code

# Plot the dendrogram
sizeGrWindow(6,6)
par(cex = 1.0)
plotEigengeneNetworks(MET, "Eigengene dendrogram", 
                      marDendro = c(0,4,2,0),
                      plotHeatmaps = FALSE)

# Plot the heatmap matrix (note: this plot will overwrite the dendrogram plot)
par(cex = 1.0)
plotEigengeneNetworks(MET, "Eigengene adjacency heatmap", 
                      marHeatmap = c(3,4,2,2),
                      plotDendrograms = FALSE, 
                      xLabelsAngle = 90)


#The eigengene dendrogram and heatmap identify groups of correlated eigengenes termed meta-modules. 
#For example, the dendrogram indicates that red, brown and bluw modules are highly related; 
#their mutual correlations are stronger than their correlations with weight. 
#On the other hand, the salmon module, which is also significantly correlated with weight, is not part of the same meta-module as the red, brown and blue modules, at least if meta-modules are defined as tight custers of modules (for example, modules with a correlation of eigengenes of at least 0.5).

#6.a   Exporting to VisANT
#====

### The package provides a convenient function for exporting the network to VisANT [1]. 
###We illustrate a simple export of the full weighted network of a single module.

# Recalculate topological overlap
TOM = TOMsimilarityFromExpr(data_raw1, power = 6);
# Read in the annotation file

lnames = load(file = "data-project/annotation-final.RData")

# Select module
module = "brown";
# Select module probes
probes = names(data_raw1)
inModule = (moduleColors==module);
modProbes = probes[inModule];
# Select the corresponding Topological Overlap
modTOM = TOM[inModule, inModule];
dimnames(modTOM) = list(modProbes, modProbes)
# Export the network into an edge list file VisANT can read
vis = exportNetworkToVisANT(modTOM,
                            file = paste("export/VisANTInput-", module, ".txt", sep=""),
                            weighted = TRUE,
                            threshold = 0,
                            probeToGene = data.frame(annotation_final$ensembl_gene_id, annotation_final$gene_symbol) )

###Because the brown module is rather large, 
#we can restrict the genes in the output to say the 30 top hub genes in the module:

nTop = 30;
IMConn = softConnectivity(data_raw1[, modProbes]);
top = (rank(-IMConn) <= nTop)
vis = exportNetworkToVisANT(modTOM[top, top],
                            file = paste("export/VisANTInput-", module, "-top30.txt", sep=""),
                            weighted = TRUE,
                            threshold = 0,
                            probeToGene = data.frame(annot$ensembl_gene_id, annot$gene_symbol) )

#6.b   Exporting to Cytoscape
#====    


### Cytoscape [2] allows the user to input an edge file and a node file, allowing the user to specify for example the link weights and the node colors.

### Here we demonstrate the output of two modules, the red and brown ones, to Cytoscape.

# Recalculate topological overlap if needed
TOM = TOMsimilarityFromExpr(data_raw1, power = 6)

# Read in the annotation file
lnames = load(file = "data-project/annotation-final.RData")

# Select modules
modules = c("brown", "red")

# Select module probes
probes = names(data_raw1)
inModule = is.finite(match(moduleColors, modules))
modProbes = probes[inModule]
modGenes = annot$gene_symbol[match(modProbes, annot$ensembl_gene_id)]

# Select the corresponding Topological Overlap
modTOM = TOM[inModule, inModule]

dimnames(modTOM) = list(modProbes, modProbes)
# Export the network into edge and node list files Cytoscape can read
cyt = exportNetworkToCytoscape(modTOM,
                               edgeFile = paste("export/CytoscapeInput-edges-", 
                                                paste(modules, collapse="-"),
                                                ".txt", sep=""),
                               nodeFile = paste("export/CytoscapeInput-nodes-", 
                                                paste(modules, collapse="-"),
                                                ".txt", sep=""),
                               weighted = TRUE,
                               threshold = 0.02,
                               nodeNames = modProbes,
                               altNodeNames = modGenes,
                               nodeAttr = moduleColors[inModule])


#Note that network input to Cytoscape is a bit more involved and the user should take care to select all necessary
#options for the edge and node files to be interpreted correctly. We refer the reader to Cytoscape documentation for
#all the necessary details.
